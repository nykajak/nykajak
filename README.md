## About Me 
Hey there! I'm a Computer Science Student with a passion for learning new things and building stuff with them. Most of my projects are going to be in Python (Flask and other backend oriented tools), but the more recent ones will have a lot more front end stuff like React and Vue involved in them too.

## Currently working on
I am working on learning web technologies like VueJS, Express and Axios to round out my tech stack. I also have a chess simulator, Caissa, that I want to keep working on and a lot more projects in my future.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on more open source projects to hone my skillset as well as advance my career by doing internships.
